#phpBB3 kickstarter style to use with the YAML CSS-Framework (v4.0.1)

This styles is like a kickstarter for your individual YAML style. So it contains just the YAML grid layout, HTML5 templates and some default colors.

##Stylesheets

The CSS is splitted into the YAML core, the basic phpBB3 YAML grid and your individual layout. The first to parts don't has to be edited because all the layout is done in the last part.

If you need special layouts and new classes in the HTML templates feel free to integrate them.
